# FPS Results
In this directory, results of `fpsGenerator.sh` are stored.

Each file is named by using SHA1 hash of arguments, used while calling FPS counting.
This may not be consistant over script changes, but it's consistent enought to append results of
multiple test runs into specific files correctly.
